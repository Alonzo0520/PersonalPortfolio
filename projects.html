                <p>Cannabis Retail Sales Analysis Program Overview

                    The Cannabis Retail Sales Analysis Program is a Python script designed to analyze and visualize retail sales data in the cannabis industry. It utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. Purpose
                    
                    The purpose of this program is to provide insights into the distribution of adult-use and medical marijuana retail sales over a specific time period. By analyzing sales data, stakeholders in the cannabis industry can better understand consumer trends, market dynamics, and the overall performance of retail sales channels. Functionality
                    
                    The program performs the following tasks:
                    
                    Data Loading: It loads sales data from a CSV file named "Cannabis_Retail_Sales_by_Week_Ending.csv".
                    
                    Data Analysis: It generates histograms to visualize the distribution of adult-use retail sales and medical marijuana retail sales separately.
                    
                    Visualization: It uses Matplotlib to create histograms that display the frequency distribution of sales amounts for both adult-use and medical marijuana products.
                    
                    The program will generate histograms displaying the distribution of adult-use and medical marijuana retail sales, providing insights into sales trends.</p>
